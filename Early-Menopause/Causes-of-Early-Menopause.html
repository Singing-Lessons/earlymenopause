<p>Early menopause happens when a woman's periods stop before the age of 45. It can happen naturally, or as a side effect of some treatments. For most women, the menopause starts between the ages of 45 and 55. If you're under 45 and have noticed your periods becoming infrequent or stopping altogether, you should speak to a gp.</p>
<p>White women who experience early menopause are three times more likely to also experience heart trouble at a younger age than their peers who undergo menopause later in life, new research shows. The study compared heart disease risk in white and black women who underwent menopause before age 40 with those who started afterward. Menopause most of ten begins between ages 45 and 55.</p>
<p>The menopause is caused by a change in the balance of the body's sex hormones, which occurs as you get older. It happens when your ovaries stop producing as much of the hormone oestrogen and no longer release an egg each month. Premature or early menopause can occur at any age, and in many cases there's no clear cause.</p>
<p>Most women begin menopause between the ages of 45 and 55. The average age for menopause onset in the united states is 51 years old. <a title="Early menopause" href="https://didyouseeitontv.com/Power-of-Hormones">Early menopause</a> usually refers to onset before age 45. Premature menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency occurs before age 40. Menopause occurs when your ovaries stop producing eggs, resulting in low estrogen levels. Estrogen is the hormone that controls the reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Menopause that happens before age 40 is called premature menopause. Menopause that happens between 40 and 45 is called early menopause. About 5% of women naturally go through early menopause. Smoking and certain medicines or treatments can cause menopause to come earlier than usual.</p>
<p>So you missed a period. Or two. You think to yourself, I'm too young for menopause. Right? Not necessarily. Early menopause , between the ages of 40 and 45, affects about 5 percent of women. Premature menopause, before age 40, affects about 1 percent of women. You are said to be in menopause if you have gone a full 12 months with no menstrual period. That's when your ovaries stop making estrogen and progesterone, the female hormones necessary to maintain your menstrual cycles and fertility. For most women, menopause occurs naturally at about age 51. With increasing life expectancy, many women will spend up to 40 percent of their lives in the postmenopausal stage.</p>
<p>What are some of the reasons why women would go through an early menopause? I'ts actually a very complicated subject and if there's anyone reading this who has had a menopause before the age of 45 they need specialist help. Thats the first thing to say. There are a number of factors.</p>
<p>Premature menopause and <a title="early menopause" href="https://didyouseeitontv.com/Power-of-Hormones">early menopause</a> are conditions where a woman goes through menopause at an earlier age than is typically expected. Both conditions can result in women being unable to become pregnant. If there is no obvious medical or surgical cause for the premature menopause, this is called primary ovarian insufficiency (poi). Primary ovarian insufficiency is also referred to as premature ovarian insufficiency.</p>
<p>Premature or early menopause can occur at any age, and in many cases, there's no clear cause. Sometimes it's caused by a treatment such as surgery to remove the ovaries (oophorectomy), some breast cancer treatments, chemotherapy or radiotherapy , or it can be brought on by an underlying medical condition, such as down's syndrome or addison's disease.</p>
<p>An early menopause can also affect your sex life and sexuality.</p>
<p>To review and summarize current evidence on the health consequences of premature menopause and early menopause.</p>
<h2 id="2">Symptoms of early menopause</h2>
<p>Early menopause and poi is medically defined as the cessation of menstruation, but it can be so much more than that. The symptoms of early menopause and the impact on fertility can be upsetting and have a serious impact on mental well-being. "a woman who finds herself with the symptoms of poi who hasn't had a family, that's a big issue. The loss of fertility and the psychological impact of that can be huge. Even for a woman who has had a family. Having the decision taken away from her is difficult," says spowart. <img style="max-width: 30%; margin: 5px;" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/ame-prod-goodhousekeeping-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/main/embedded/43052/early-menopause.jpg?crop\u003d1xw:0.5xh;center,top\u0026resize\u003d1200:*" alt="women" align="left" /></p>
<p>Cbt is a talking therapy that helps you develop practical ways of managing problems by changing the way you think or behave. It can help women who have low mood or anxiety as a result of early menopause. It can also help you learn to cope with other symptoms of the menopause, like hot flushes.</p>
<p>The term premature ovarian insufficiency (poi) is sometimes used interchangeably with early menopause. It can also be called premature ovarian failure. It means you have experienced the menopause before the age of 40. The most obvious effects are early symptoms of the menopause, including your periods stopping, and reduced fertility. But women who experience poi are also known to be at higher risk of coronary heart disease. This is because oestrogen has a protective effect on your body, including your blood vessels. When you have poi, your oestrogen levels drop. Poi is also linked to lower levels of bone density and higher rates of osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for menopause symptoms the severity of symptoms varies tremendously between women; they may come on very suddenly after surgery and be noticeable straight away, for other women, maybe after chemotherapy, it might be a gradual change that you wont initially realise is related to an early menopause.</p>
<p>Menopause matters is an independent website providing up-to-date, accurate information about the menopause, menopausal symptoms and treatment options. Henpicked also contains lots of information about the menopause, including early and surgically-induced menopause. The daisy network has lots of useful information for younger women who are having issues with early menopause. You can also read laura moses&acirc;s.</p>
<p>The symptoms of early menopause are the same as for menopause at the typical age and can include: menstrual cycle changes, including changes to the usual bleeding pattern, particularly irregular bleeding and viral infections the evidence is inconclusive, but it is thought that a viral infection, such as mumps or cytomegalovirus, could trigger premature menopause in some women.</p>
<p>If a person undergoes surgery to remove their ovaries, they will experience menopause. If this happens before middle age, doctors may refer to it as early menopause. A doctor may recommend hormone therapy to reduce some symptoms, but as always, it is important to discuss the risks as well as the potential benefits of this treatment.</p>
<p>The primary symptom of early menopause is that periods are infrequent or stopping altogether. This time leading to the menopause is called the perimenopause, which is when irregular periods and some of the following symptoms occur: vaginal pain during intercourse.</p>
<p>Menopause before the age of 40 is called 'premature menopause' and before age 45 is called 'early menopause'. At any age, menopause of ten starts with a change in menstrual periods (skipping periods), hot flushes and night sweats. It is not known whether symptoms from premature or early menopause are more severe or longer-lasting than those at natural menopause.</p>
<p>The menopause affects everyone differently, and many people experience an early or premature menopause without realising at first. You may only discover this when your periods get less regular or stop altogether. Some people also experience other common symptoms of the menopause, like hot flushes and night sweats.</p>
<p>In addition to the signs and symptoms that occur with natural menopause, early entry into menopause causes severe anxiety in many women. Furthermore, the effect on fertility is one of the greatest impacts of early menopause. Early menopause is one of the principal causes of infertility in western countries. Fertility normally starts to decrease at around 30 years of age and then begins to decline dramatically at the age of 41 years, with natural menopause normally occurring at around age 51. In women who experience early menopause, fertility begins to decline even earlier, resulting in a greatly shortened reproductive period. Women with a high risk of early menopause who have not given birth by the age of 30 will find it hard to conceive. Furthermore, early menopause increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.</p>
<h3 id="3">Treatments for early menopause</h3>
<p>Some medicines and treatments prescribed by your doctor can cause a premature menopause: some types of anti-depressants and other similar types of medications chemotherapy and radiotherapy - these are perhaps the most common cause of premature or early menopause. These treatments are intended to treat cancerous cells but also cause damage to healthy cells, particularly the genetic material in them which enables them to naturally multiply. In some cases, periods may begin again once the treatment has been completed, in which case you are not considered to be menopausal. <img style="max-width: 50%; margin: 5px;" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/80/5f/3a/805f3afdfabf54f6331fc5686dafb1f3.png" alt="early" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are many causes of premature or early menopause. It is clear that surgery to remove the ovaries (oophorectomy) results in instant menopause, and chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments cause ovaries to weaken, but the causes of poi are not always as clear. In about 60% of women, a cause cannot be found.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy is usually administered as part of cancer treatment but may also be given to women with severe connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosis or kidney disease such as wegener,s granulomatosis. Survival rates for many cancers in women of reproductive age are increasing. However, many treatments used to combat the disease carry a substantial risk for future infertility. Chemotherapy is toxic to the ovaries causing loss of eggs and destruction of the supporting ovarian tissue. This may cause temporary cessation of menstrual periods or early menopause which can develop quickly or gradually.</p>
<p>Smoking, a family history, certain treatments such as cancer treatment and surgery such as a hysterectomy (removal of the womb) can bring on the menopause sooner. In many cases, there is no known cause for poi or early menopause. For many women, going through the menopause sooner than expected can be distressing. They might feel as if they have somehow failed as a woman, they have not completed their family yet, or they struggle to cope with unexpected menopausal symptoms. There are also health implications as an earlier menopause is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis (brittle bones), cardiovascular disease (diseases of the heart and blood vessels) and poor memory.</p>
<p>Breast cancer treatments such as chemotherapy , hormone (endocrine) therapy or ovarian suppression (stopping the ovaries working either permanently or temporarily) can cause menopausal symptoms. Some women find these symptoms manageable, but many find they are difficult to cope with and can affect their quality of life. In premenopausal women, some treatments may cause an early menopause, leading to the symptoms described below. Some treatments will not cause an early menopause but may cause the symptoms associated with it.</p>
<p>In about two-thirds of women who go through premature or early menopause, physicians can't identify a cause, according to depree. In some cases, like the surgical removal of ovaries , the cause is obvious. This procedure may be used to treat ovarian cancer and endometriosis and is used preventively in women with increased risk of breast or ovarian cancer. Other cancer treatments, namely chemotherapy and radiation, are toxic to the ovaries and may induce early menopause as well.</p>
<p>If menopause happens before age 40, it is called a premature ovarian insufficiency (poi). If menopause happens between ages 40 and 45, it is called a premature or early menopause. The menopause may be naturally premature or early. But menopause can also happen if your ovaries stop working due to some cervical cancer treatments.</p>
<h2 id="4">Symptoms of the menopause</h2>
<p>In the u. S. <img style="max-width: 20%; margin: 3px;" src="https://23md.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/menopause-1.png" alt="age" align="left" /> , the average age of onset for "natural" menopause is 51. However, because of genetics, illness, or medical procedures , some women go through menopause before the age of 40. Menopause that occurs before this age, whether natural or induced, is known as "premature" menopause. In addition to dealing with hot flashes , mood swings , and other symptoms that accompany menopause, many women undergoing premature menopause have to cope with additional physical and emotional concerns. For example, because menopause signals the end of a woman's fertile years, a woman who wishes to get pregnant is likely to have trouble.</p>
<p>One medical cause of premature menopause is premature ovarian failure. Other causes of premature menopause include damage to the ovaries by chemotherapy and/or radiation treatments, or surgical removal of the ovaries. The symptoms of premature menopause include mood swings , vaginal dryness , cognitive changes, hot flashes , decrease in sex drive, and sleep disturbances. Symptoms are the same as those of menopause that occurs later in life.</p>
<p>What is perimenopause? The gradual transition between the reproductive years and menopause (the cessation of menstrual periods) is called perimenopause (literally meaning round menopause). It is generally a transition that is many years long and can be associated with shorter menstrual intervals, irregular menses, night sweats, and other symptoms. In some women, these symptoms are troublesome enough to need medical intervention.</p>
<p>Menopause, also known as the climacteric, is the time in women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently, and they are no longer able to bear children. Menopause typically occurs between 49 and 52 years of age. Medical prof essionals of ten define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any menstrual bleeding for a year. It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have ovaries, menopause may be considered to have occurred at the time of the surgery or when their hormone levels fell. Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms typically occur earlier, at an average of 45 years of age.</p>
<p>Some women may have no symptoms, except that they cannot become pregnant. Other women develop the same symptoms that are associated with normal menopause (which occurs at about age 51), such as hot flashes, night sweats, or mood swings. Menstrual periods may become lighter or irregular, or they may stop.</p>
<p>The menopause usually occurs in a womans early 50s, but can happen earlier ( see section below on premature menopause ) or later. Although the symptoms may go on for a number of years, menopause is said to have taken place when a woman has not had a period for 12 months.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Carrie lam , who is board-certified in family, anti-aging, and regenerative medicines, the symptoms of menopause include lowered libido, vaginal dryness and painful sex, tiredness and insomnia, and increased allergies. And Dr. Renee wellsenstein , a double-board certified ob/gyn and functional medicine specialist, adds to that list hot flashes, night sweats, weight gain, and mood changes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;all of which, she says, are of ten associated with a loss of confidence, self-esteem, and poorer memory. She adds that their cumulative effect can lead to decreased performance at work where, typically, menopause is not discussed.</p>
<p>The main symptom of early menopause is periods becoming infrequent or stopping altogether without any other reason (such as pregnancy). Some women may also get other typical menopausal symptoms, including: vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex difficulty sleeping read more about the symptoms of the menopause. Women who go through early menopause also have an increased risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease because of their lowered oestrogen hormone levels.</p>
<p>Menopause is a normal part of aging. Normal as it may be, menopause can feel anything but. Changes to your body and mood may have you flashing back to puberty: is this normal? what comes next? do i need to do something? your experience with menopause will be unique &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; from when it starts to the types of menopause symptoms you,ll feel as you age. But there are usually some signs to tell you where you may be at in the process.</p>
<h3 id="5">What causes the menopause?</h3>
<p>Hot flashes are the most common menopause-related discomfort. They involve a sudden wave of heat or warmth of ten accompanied by sweating, reddening of the skin, and rapid heart beat. They usually last 1 to 5 minutes. Hot flashes frequently are followed by a cold chill. Night sweats are hot flashes at night that interfere with sleep. While it's a myth that menopause itself makes women irritable, the sleep disturbances that stem from hot flashes and night sweats can certainly make a woman irritable. Treatments for night sweats and hot flashes include lifestyle changes, nonprescription remedies, hormone therapy (with estrogen plus progestogen, or estrogen alone for women without a uterus), and nonhormonal prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Perimenopause is the period before the menopause characterized by irregular cycles of ovulation and menstruation and ends 12 months after the last menstrual period. Postmenopause is the time after a woman has not had a menstrual period for 12 consecutive months. Early menopause is the cessation of ovarian function between 40 and 45 years, in the absence of other causes of secondary amenorrhoea.</p>
<p>Some breast cancer treatments can bring on menopause more abruptly than it would happen otherwise. Again, this is called medical menopause if it's caused by medicines such as chemotherapy, or surgical menopause if it's caused by removal of the ovaries. Medical menopause may be a temporary state that lasts while you're in treatment and for some time afterwards, or it can be permanent. Surgical menopause is always permanent.</p>
<p>Most women don't even think about the hormonal roller coaster that is the menopause until they hit their mid-40s, with 51 being the average age for women's periods to actually stop. But adele stevens is dealing with hot flushes, mood swings and the end of her fertility aged just 25. To make matters worse, she&acirc;&euro;&trade;s going through it at the same time as her mum, who is in her 50s.</p>
<p>Reproductive health early menopause triples the chance of women experiencing multiple chronic conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, in their 60s, a study suggests. Most women will go through the menopause after 50, but the new research suggests that those who experience the change at 40 or younger are at far greater risk of illness and should be screened.</p>
<p>Early menopause can happen naturally if a woman's ovaries stop making normal levels of certain hormones, particularly the hormone oestrogen. This is sometimes called premature ovarian failure, or primary ovarian insufficiency. The cause of premature ovarian failure is of ten unknown, but in some women it may be caused by: chromosome abnormalities such as in women with turner syndrome.</p>
<h3 id="6">What Causes Early Menopause?</h3>
<p>Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause premature ovarian failure. This may be permanent or temporary. Your risk of having an early menopause will depend on: your age girls who have not yet reached puberty can tolerate stronger treatment than older women the type of treatment you're given different types of chemotherapy may affect the ovaries differently.</p>
<p>Surgically removing both ovaries will also bring on premature or early menopause. For example, the ovaries may need to be removed during a hysterectomy (an operation to remove the womb).</p>
<p>To investigate whether there was a link between early menstruation and early menopause, gita mishra at the university of queensland, australia, and her colleagues performed a statistical analysis, adjusting for possible confounding variables like weight and smoking. They found that women who began menstruating before the age of 12 were 31 per cent more likely to have an early menopause between the ages of 40 and 44.</p>
<p>Menopause is the time at which a woman permanently stops menstruating, usually between 45 and 55 years of age, and is diagnosed after 12 months of amenorrhea. It is preceded by the climacteric period , sometimes referred to as perimenopause or menopausal transition , which is the transition period in a woman's life from the time of full sexual maturity to the onset of menopause. The physical manifestations are caused by hormonal changes (primarily a drop in progesterone and estrogen levels) that occur during the climacteric period. Clinical features leading up to menopause include irregular menses , autonomic symptoms (e. G. , hot flashes), mental symptoms (e. G. , mood swings), and atrophic features (e. G. , reduced breast size, vaginal atrophy ). Menopausal transition is a natural phase of the aging process in females, and as such does not usually warrant treatment. However, treatment is warranted in the case of severe symptoms or early onset menopause. The choice of treatment is decided on a case-by-case basis and includes conservative methods, hormone replacement therapy , and non-hormonal therapy. Menopause occurring before the age of 40 is considered premature. A common cause of premature menopause is ovarian insufficiency. The diagnosis is confirmed by increased fsh levels occurring after more than three months of amenorrhea in a woman under the age of 40. Treatment involves hormone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>The main treatment for early menopause is either the combined contraceptive pill or hrt to make up for your missing hormones. A gp will probably recommend that you take this treatment long term, beyond the "normal" age of natural menopause (around 52 on average), to give you lasting protection. If you have had certain types of cancer, such as certain types of breast cancer, you may not be able to have hormonal treatment.</p>
<p>Going through the menopause early can be very difficult and upsetting. Permanent early menopause will affect your ability to have children naturally. This can be very distressing to women of all ages. You may still be able to have children by using ivf and donated eggs from another woman, or using your own eggs if you had some stored. Surrogacy and adoption may also be options for you.</p>
<p>Primary ovarian insufficiency (poi), also known as <a title="early menopause" href="https://didyouseeitontv.com/Power-of-Hormones">early menopause</a> premature ovarian failure, happens when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. Many women naturally experience reduced fertility when they are about 40 years old. They may start getting irregular menstrual periods as they transition to menopause. For women with poi, irregular periods and reduced fertility start before the age of 40. Sometimes it can start as early as the teenage years.</p>
<p>Premature menopause , which is defined as not having a period for 12 consecutive months before age 40, is even more common in developing countries such as india, where women who live in rural areas experience menopause about eight years earlier than in the united states. Researchers arent exactly sure what causes early menopause, but a study from londons imperial college indicates that smoking and socioeconomic status may be at least partly to blame.</p>
<p>A staggering three quarters of women say that the menopause caused them to change their life and over half say it had a negative impact on their lives. To mark world menopause day 2020, we asked annabel may oakley-watson, 24, a film editor, to share her first person account of what going through the menopause early - at the tender age of 15 - was really like.</p>
<h3 id="7">Early or premature menopause</h3>
<p>After menopause, it's expected for women to experience body changes linked to fluctuating hormonal levels. In past studies, it was known that reduced levels of estrogen have been associated with a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and hypertension, among others. A team of researchers at the center for longitudinal and life course research at the university of queensland, brisbane (australia) has found that women who experience early menopause or premature menopause are almost three times more likely to develop medical problems in their 60s, compared to those who had their menopause at the age of 50 or 51.</p>
<p>For most women in the uk, the menopause occurs around the age of 52 although it can happen anywhere between 45 and 55. But for a small percentage of women premature menopause, also known as premature ovarian insufficiency, can occur decades earlier. Early menopause occurs before the age of 45, whereas premature menopause occurs before 40.</p>
